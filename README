Building
Build the code in the directory you are interested in, command-line, mac, or sequential-web. You don't need to manually build the code in client or in directories you aren't interested in.

Using the command-line interface
First make sure to run make(1). Then run index.js to start the server. Then run open.js [path] to open a local path. Thumbnail generation TBD.
